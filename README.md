# 📝 Problem Statement
🧩 Understanding blockchain technology, especially Ethereum, can be complex and intimidating for beginners. ⚡ Traditional educational resources often lack engagement, making it difficult for users to grasp essential concepts like smart contracts 📝, gas fees ⛽, and decentralized applications (dApps) 🌐.  

📚 Furthermore, crypto education is often dry and technical, discouraging new learners from exploring the potential of blockchain 🚀. There is a need for an interactive 🎮 and gamified 🏆 approach that makes learning about Ethereum fun, immersive, and accessible.

# 💡 Our Solution
A gamified dApp for learning about the ethereum blockchain 
This is a project created for <b>ETH Oxford 2025</b>. The goal was to essentialize our Ethereum and crypto learning experience into an <b>engaging educational game</b>. Will you survive and thrive while learning 
about crypto or will you send CryptMeow to Mekdi??? 🍔😼 Play to find out!
